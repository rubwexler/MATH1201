If you are weak in your math fundamentals, I would recommend taking an introductory algebra, intermediate algebra, or a college algebra
course from mathhelp.com .  The lectures are great and they give you many practice problems and step by step examples. It's designed for
students learning completely on their own (which is why a lot of homeschool students use this website).
